MMTrace --- a valgrind tool for memory tracing. I still don't get some
types of memaccess, but the miss is not so big.

HowTo:
1) Get valgrind 3.2.0
2) apply patches from patches/ subdir
3) compile and install valgrind

4) get renoveau source.
5) copy/link the following files from renoveau to nvidia/ subdir:
   disasm_fp.c disasm_vp.c nv40_reg.h nv_hw.h nv_objects.h objects.c objects.h
6) compile mmtrace
7) copy mmtrace to the valgrind tools directory
   (probably it's something like /usr/local/lib/valgrind/x86-linux/)

8) valgrind --tool=mmtrace <your_GL_program>
